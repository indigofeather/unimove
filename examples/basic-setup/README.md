# Basic Setup Example

This example demonstrates the basic setup and initialization of the Unimove SDK with improved TypeScript support.

## Features Demonstrated

- ✅ SDK initialization with type safety
- ✅ Unified API usage
- ✅ Basic client operations
- ✅ Type-safe network configuration

## Key Improvements Shown

- **Precise Type Inference**: SDK provides exact types based on chain selection
- **Unified API**: Same methods work for both SUI and IOTA
- **No More `any` Types**: Complete type safety throughout

## Files

- `sdk-initialization.ts` - Basic SDK setup
- `unified-api.ts` - Using unified API methods
