# Type Safety Example

This example demonstrates the advanced TypeScript integration and type safety features of the Unimove SDK.

## Features Demonstrated

- ✅ Precise type inference across all operations
- ✅ Conditional types for chain-specific operations
- ✅ Function overloads for flexible usage
- ✅ Complete elimination of `any` types
- ✅ Advanced type patterns and utilities

## Key Improvements Shown

- **Zero `any` Types**: Complete type safety throughout the SDK
- **Conditional Types**: Precise types based on chain selection
- **Function Overloads**: Support for multiple usage patterns
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type checking with compile-time benefits
